SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) busses

SPI busses can be described with a node for the SPI master device
and a set of child nodes for each SPI slave on the bus.  For this
discussion, it is assumed that the system's SPI controller is in
SPI master mode.  This binding does not describe SPI controllers
in slave mode.

The SPI master node requires the following properties:
- #address-cells  - number of cells required to define a chip select
		    address on the SPI bus.
- #size-cells     - should be zero.
- compatible      - name of SPI bus controller following generic names
		    recommended practice.

SPI slave nodes must be children of the SPI master node and can
contain the following properties.
- reg             - (required) chip select address of device.
- compatible      - (required) name of SPI device following generic names
		    recommended practice
- spi-max-frequency - (required) Maximum SPI clocking speed of device in Hz
- spi-cpol        - (optional) Empty property indicating device requires
		    inverse clock polarity (CPOL) mode
- spi-cpha        - (optional) Empty property indicating device requires
		    shifted clock phase (CPHA) mode
- spi-cs-high     - (optional) Empty property indicating device requires
		    chip select active high

SPI example for an SPI flash chip on the SPI bus:

	spi@12d30000 { /* spi1 */
		compatible = "gigaflash,gd25lq";
		firmware_storage_spi: flash@0 {
			reg = <0>;
			spi-max-frequency = <50000000>;
		};
	};
