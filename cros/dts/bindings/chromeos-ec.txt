Chrome EC bindings
==================

The device tree node which describes the Chrome Embedded Controller (EC)
is as follows:

Required properties :
- compatible = "google,chrome-ec"
- model : Manufacturer and part number of EC part
- flash : Contains address and size of flash memory (in standard reg property)


Optional properties within flash node :
- erase-value : Value that flash erases to, typically 0xff or 0. If -1, or
   missing, then it means that the value is not known.


Example
=======

	chrome-ec {
		compatible = "google,chrome-ec";
		model = "st,stm32f100";
		flash@8000000 {
			reg = <0x08000000 0x20000>;
			erase-value = <0xff>;
		};
	};
