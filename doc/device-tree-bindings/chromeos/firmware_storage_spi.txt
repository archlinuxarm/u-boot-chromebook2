Chrome OS Firmware Storage Binding
==================================

The device tree node which describes how firmware is stored on the device is
as follows:

Optional properties :
- bus : The number of the SPI bus the storage is on. Defaults to zero.
- reg : The chip select for the storage device. Defaults to zero.
- spi-max-frequency : Sets the maximum frequency (in Hz) for SPI bus
   operation. Defaults to 1MHz.
- spi-cpol : Boolean property - if present, changes the clock polarity.
- spi-cpha : Boolean property - if present, changes the clock phase.
- spi-cs-high : Boolean property - if present, CS is active high.
- elog-panic-event-offset: The offset into DRAM and size of the event log
   panic event buffer. Is communicated to the kernle through "elog-panic-event"
   property converted to absolute address DRAM.
- elog-shrink-size : The amount of buffer to clear when the event log is too
   full.
- elog-full-threshold : How much data can be in the event log before it's
   considered full.

The firmware_storage_spi node should appear as a subnode of the spi bus the
storage it describes is attached to.

Example
=======

	spi@12d30000 {
		firmware_storage_spi: flash@0 {
			bus = <1>;
			spi-max-frequency = <45000000>;

			/*
			 * A region for the kernel to store a panic event
			 * which the firmware will add to the log.
			 */
			elog-panic-event-offset = <0x01fff000 0x1000>;

			elog-shrink-size = <0x400>;
			elog-full-threshold = <0xc00>;
		};
	};
