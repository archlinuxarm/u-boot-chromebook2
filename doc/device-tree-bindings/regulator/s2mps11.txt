* Samsung S2MPS11 Voltage and Current Regulator

The Samsung S2MP211 is a multi-function device which includes volatage and
current regulators, rtc, charger controller and other sub-blocks. It is
interfaced to the host controller using a i2c interface. Each sub-block is
addressed by the host system using different i2c slave address. This document
describes the bindings for 'pmic' sub-block of s2mps11.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "samsung,s2mps11-pmic".
- reg: Specifies the i2c slave address of the pmic block. It should be 0x66.

Optional properties:
- interrupt-parent: Specifies the phandle of the interrupt controller to which
  the interrupts from s2mps11 are delivered to.
- interrupts: Interrupt specifiers for interrupt sources.
- ramp_delay: Ramp delay for BUCKs.
- ramp_enable: The ramp delay enable/disable control.

Regulators: The regulators of s2mps11 that have to be instantiated should be
included in a sub-node named 'regulators'. Regulator nodes included in this
sub-node should be of the format as listed below.

	regulator_name {
		standard regulator bindings here
	};

The following are the names of the regulators that the s2mps11 pmic block
supports. Note: The 'n' in LDOn and BUCKn represents the LDO or BUCK number
as per the datasheet of s2mps11.

	- LDOn
		  - valid values for n are 1 to 28
		  - Example: LDO0, LD01, LDO28
	- BUCKn
		  - valid values for n are 1 to 9.
		  - Example: BUCK1, BUCK2, BUCK9

The bindings inside the regulator nodes use the standard regulator bindings
which are documented elsewhere.

Example:

	s2mps11_pmic@66 {
		compatible = "samsung,s2mps11-pmic";
		reg = <0x66>;
		s2mps11,buck2-ramp-delay = <12>;
		s2mps11,buck6-ramp-enable = <1>;

		regulators {
			ldo1_reg: LDO1 {
				regulator-name = "VDD_ABB_3.3V";
				regulator-min-microvolt = <3300000>;
				regulator-max-microvolt = <3300000>;
			};

			ldo2_reg: LDO2 {
				regulator-name = "VDD_ALIVE_1.1V";
				regulator-min-microvolt = <1100000>;
				regulator-max-microvolt = <1100000>;
				regulator-always-on;
			};

			buck1_reg: BUCK1 {
				regulator-name = "VDD_MIF_1.2V";
				regulator-min-microvolt = <950000>;
				regulator-max-microvolt = <1350000>;
				regulator-always-on;
				regulator-boot-on;
			};
		};
	};
